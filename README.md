# AboutMe
Let me tell you something about myself.
---------
Hello, I’m Chiriac Alina and this is my GitHub portfolio.

I’m interested in Quality Assurance Software Testing.

I’m looking to collaborate on Software Testing opportunities.

In order to develop myself I did/do online QA courses, where I learned about agile, manual testing, API testing using Postman, writing bug reports in Jira & test cases, automation testing using CypressJS and automation testing with Selenium (ongoing).

I'm always willing to learn new things and discover new pasions. I consider myself optimistic, curious, organised, responsable, serious, and I have a strong desire to learn new things.
